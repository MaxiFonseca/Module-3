   <div class="text-center"><span><h3>Cheesecake</h3><p>Cheesecakes are made-up from two or three components layered in a special pan called a Springform or in a solid baking pan: optionally, a crust on the bottom, sometimes prebaked; a filling, in the middle, which can be savory or sweet; and optionally including a topping, such as fruit, sour cream, cookie crumbs or chocolate. Its filling is really baked custard, based on an egg protein structure, which sets into a semi-rigid gel, and needs to be treated as such.
   <div><h3>History</h3></div><div>An ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in ancient Greece even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece.The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician Aegimus (5th century BCE), who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes (πλακουντοποιικόν σύγγραμμα—plakountopoiikon sungramma).The earliest extant cheesecake recipes are found in Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura, which includes recipes for three cakes for religious uses: libum, savillum and placenta.Of the three, placenta cake is the most like modern cheesecakes: having a crust that is separately prepared and baked.</div><div>A more modern version called a sambocade, made with elderflower and rose water, is found in Forme of Cury, an English cookbook from 1390.On this basis, chef Heston Blumenthal has argued that cheesecake is an English invention.</div><div><h3>The modern cheesecake</h3></div><div>The English name cheesecake has been used only since the 15th century,and the cheesecake did not evolve into its modern form until somewhere around the 18th century. Europeans began removing yeast and adding beaten eggs to the cheesecake instead. With the overpowering yeast flavor gone, the result tasted more like a dessert treat.The early 19th-century cheesecake recipes in A New System of Domestic Cookery by Maria Rundell are made with cheese curd and fresh butter. One version is thickened with blanched almonds, eggs and cream, and the cakes may have included currants, brandy, raisin wine, nutmeg and orange flower water.</div><div>Modern commercial American cream cheese was developed in 1872, when William Lawrence, from Chester, New York, while looking for a way to recreate the soft, French cheese Neufchâtel, accidentally came up with a way of making an "unripened cheese" that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came up with similar creations independently.</div><div>Modern cheesecake comes in two different types. Along with the baked cheesecake, some cheesecakes are made with uncooked cream cheese on a crumbled-cookie or graham cracker base. This type of cheesecake was invented in the United States.</div>
